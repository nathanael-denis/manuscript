abstract = "Public key encryption with equality test (PKEET) is a special kind of public encryption scheme (PKE) that allows a tester to perform equality tests on ciphertexts generated by different public keys as well as the same public key. This feature enables us to apply PKEET to various scenarios in practice, such as efficient data management on encrypted databases and spam filtering in encrypted email systems. From these reasons, since Yang et al. [1] first proposed the concept of PKEET, there have been proposed many PKEET schemes to improve efficiency or to enhance functionalities. However, to the best of our knowledge, almost all existing schemes were presented under assuming the existence of random oracles, except for generic construction proposed by Lee et al. On the other hand, their generic approach for PKEET employs a 2-level hierarchical identity-based encryption and a strongly unforgeable one-time signature, which suffers from low efficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient PKEET scheme under a specific cryptographic assumption in the standard model. To this end, we first encrypt a message and its hash value in a parallel way by following the recently proposed strategy. Then, to prevent adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA2), we give a link between them by adapting the technique which was originally proposed for identity-based encryption and previously exploited to design efficient CCA2-secure PKE schemes. We show that our proposed construction satisfies formal security requirements for PKEET under the decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman (DBDH) assumption in the standard model. As a result, we obtain a new PKEET scheme which has shorter ciphertext and trapdoor sizes, and improves computational costs for encryption, decryption, and test algorithms, by about 60%, 77%, and 66%, respectively, compared to a PKEET instantiation obtained by the prior generic framework.",

abstract = "The publish/subscribe model offers a loosely-coupled communication paradigm where applications interact indirectly and asynchronously. Publishers generate events that are sent to interested applications through a network of brokers. Subscribers express their interest by specifying filters that brokers can use for routing the events. Supporting confidentiality of messages being exchanged is still challenging. First of all, it is desirable that any scheme used for protecting the confidentiality of both the events and filters should not require publishers and subscribers to share secret keys. In fact, such a restriction is against the loose-coupling of the model. Moreover, such a scheme should not restrict the expressiveness of filters and should allow the broker to perform event filtering to route the events to the interested parties. Existing solutions do not fully address these issues. In this paper, we provide a novel scheme that supports (i) confidentiality for events and filters; (ii) allows publishers to express further constraints about who can access their events; (iii) filters that can express very complex constraints on events even if brokers are not able to access any information in clear on both events and filters; (iv) and, finally, it does not require publishers and subscribers to share keys. Furthermore, we show how we applied our scheme to a real-world e-health scenario, developed together with a hospital. We also describe the implementation of our solution in Java and the integration with an existing publish/subscribe system.",

abstract="Users of content-based publish/subscribe systems (CBPS) are interested in receiving data items with values that satisfy certain conditions. Each user submits a list of subscription specifications to a broker, which routes data items from publishers to users. When a broker receives a notification that contains a value from a publisher, it forwards it only to the subscribers whose requests match the value. However, in many applications, the data published are confidential, and their contents must not be revealed to brokers. Furthermore, a user's subscription may contain sensitive information that must be protected from brokers. Therefore, a difficult challenge arises: how to route publisher data to the appropriate subscribers without the intermediate brokers learning the plain text values of the notifications and subscriptions. To that extent, brokers must be able to perform operations on top of the encrypted contents of subscriptions and notifications. Such operations may be as simple as equality match, but often require more complex operations such as determining inclusion of data in a value interval. Previous work attempted to solve this problem by using one-way data mappings or specialized encryption functions that allow evaluation of conditions on ciphertexts. However, such operations are computationally expensive, and the resulting CBPS lack scalability. As fast dissemination is an important requirement in many applications, we focus on a new data transformation method called Asymmetric Scalar-product Preserving Encryption (ASPE) [1]. We devise methods that build upon ASPE to support private evaluation of several types of conditions. We also suggest techniques for secure aggregation of notifications, supporting functions such as sum, minimum, maximum and count. Our experimental evaluation shows that ASPE-based CBPS incurs 65{\%} less overhead for exact-match filtering and 50{\%} less overhead for range filtering compared to the state-of-the-art.",

A dataset provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each individual in the dataset cannot be distinguished from at least k−1 individuals whose information also appears in the dataset. There is a flaw in k-anonymity that would still allow an intruder to discern the confidential information of individuals in the anonymized data. To overcome this problem, we propose a data reconstruction approach to achieve k-anonymity protection in predictive data mining. In this approach, the potentially identifying attributes are first masked using aggregation (for numeric data) and swapping (for nominal data). A genetic algorithm technique is then applied to the masked data to find a good subset of it. This subset is then replicated to form the released dataset that satisfies the k-anonymity constraint."

In order to promote sharing of data, mechanisms need to be put into place to provide the different actors — data producers, data consumers, etc. means to control and visualize how their data or requests are being processed and used. In this paper we deal with a key issue involved in trust which is usage control, i.e., how data is used once access to it has been granted. We propose a Data Usage Control Model (DUPO) to capture the diversity of obligations and constraints that data providers impose on the use of their data. Based on the DUPO model and semantic technologies, we propose a trustworthy data sharing platform which enhances transparency and traceability of data usage in smart cities. Lastly a proof-of-concept is developed to evaluate our solution and results show that the performance of the added trust does not impact negatively on the system."

In order to clarify the complicated security and privacy issues, the life cycle of a physical object is divided into three stages of pre-working, in-working, and post-working. On this basis, a physical object-based security architecture for the IoT is put forward. According to the security architecture, security and privacy requirements and related protecting technologies for physical objects in different working stages are analyzed in detail. Considering the development of IoT technologies, potential security and privacy challenges that IoT objects may face in the pervasive computing environment are summarized. At the same time, possible directions for dealing with these challenges are also pointed out."

abstract = "Recently, blockchain technology has been used to address the security issues of Internet of things (IoT) applications. However, some issues particular to blockchain should be solved to meet the security requirements of IoT systems. The core of blockchain technology is distributed computing, along with the collaboration mechanism of group trust under the distributed computing environment, which can solve the scalability, collaboration ability, trust relationship, and security protection challenges faced by the IoT. The existing blockchain consensus protocol can only solve the trust cooperation problem with limited credibility. Although distributed trust relationship management has advantages over centralized trust relationship management, several risks exist. Here, the most critical issue is the credibility of the blockchain consensus protocol. Based on the characteristics of the traditional public chain, we propose a repute-based consensus protocol for blockchain-enabled IoT systems. In the protocol, two methods are designed to enable the blockchain system to reach a consensus rapidly and safely. The repute rewards and punishments method settles the repute values of nodes; nodes with satisfactory behavior receive repute rewards. The repute mining method proposes repute requirements for consensus nodes; nodes with high repute value produce blocks more easily. Security analysis has been conducted using a theory model and experimental evaluation. The establishment of our repute system can improve the consensus protocol, resisting stronger attacks, and giving several users with lower computing power a greater opportunity to participate in consensus. The experimental results show that the repute-based consensus protocol has advantages in terms of security and that its resistance capability against attacks is improved."

Existing consensus methods used in blockchain require high energy consumption, massive computational power with trusted authorities, or proof for mining a block. Resource constrained IoT devices need a lightweight and low latency consensus mechanism. Trust-free probabilistic consensus methods allow every node to participate in the consensus, enhancing the robustness and reliability of transactions as compared to absolute consensus methods. We propose a lightweight probabilistic proof of elapsed work and luck (PoEWAL) consensus method for non-cooperative blockchain in IoT environments. PoEWAL consumes less energy, requires less computational power and has low latency. We analyzed suitability of PoEWAL for resource constrained devices, using Contiki Cooja simulator. Experimental results show that energy consumption is low at various difficulty levels, demonstrating the feasibility of PoEWAL. Furthermore, PoEWAL is compared with such existing probabilistic consensus methods as proof of work, proof of stake, proof of activity, algorand, and proof of authority, in terms of energy, consensus time, and network latency, to confirm that PoEWAL is a suitable consensus method for blockchain in IoT."

The main advantages of blockchain for its potential use in other areas are its inherent security mechanisms and immunity to data manipulation attacks. A blockchain relies on a consensus method for agreeing on any new data. Most of the consensus methods which are currently used for the blockchain of different cryptocurrencies require high computational power and thus are not suitable for resource-constrained systems. In this article, we survey the various blockchain-based consensus methods that are applicable to resource-constrained IoT devices and networks. In a typical IoT network, there exist several devices with limited computational and communication capabilities. Most often, these devices cannot perform intensive computations and are starved for bandwidth. Therefore, we discuss the possible measures that can be taken to reduce the computational power and convergence time for the underlying consensus methods. We also talk about some of the alternatives to the public blockchain, such as private blockchain and tangle, along with their potential adoption for IoT networks. Furthermore, we review the existing consensus methods that have been implemented and explore the possibility of utilizing them to realize a blockchain-based IoT network. Some of the open research challenges including AI-enabled blockchains are also put forward."

With the increasing industrialization in IoT, an excessive amount of sensing data is producing from various sensors devices in the Industrial IoT. To analyzes of big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a significant role as a strong analytic tool and delivers a scalable and accurate analysis of data in real-time. However, the design and development of a useful big data analysis tool using AI have some challenges, such as centralized architecture, security, and privacy, resource constraints, lack of enough training data. Conversely, as an emerging technology, Blockchain supports a decentralized architecture. It provides a secure sharing of data and resources to the various nodes of the IoT network is encouraged to remove centralized control and can overcome the existing challenges in AI. The main goal of our research is to design and develop an IoT architecture with blockchain and AI to support an effective big data analysis. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-enabled Intelligent IoT Architecture with Artificial Intelligence that provides an efficient way of converging blockchain and AI for IoT with current state-of-the-art techniques and applications. We evaluate the proposed architecture and categorized into two parts: qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. In qualitative evaluation, we describe how to use AI and Blockchain in IoT applications with “AI-driven Blockchain” and “Blockchain-driven AI.” In quantitative analysis, we present a performance evaluation of the BlockIoTIntelligence architecture to compare existing researches on device, fog, edge and cloud intelligence according to some parameters such as accuracy, latency, security and privacy, computational complexity and energy cost in IoT applications. The evaluation results show that the proposed architecture performance over the existing IoT architectures and mitigate the current challenges."

Since in most of the existing attribute-based encryption methods, all user attributes are managed by a single central authority, it is easy to cause a single point of failure. Therefore, several multi-authority CP-ABE schemes are proposed to manage user attributes by multiple authorities. However, these schemes still do not eliminate the single point of failure in essence or suffer from high computation and communication overhead on data users. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based Multi-authority Access Control scheme called BMAC for sharing data securely. Shamir secret sharing scheme and permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) are introduced to implement that each attribute is jointly managed by multiple authorities to avoid single point of failure. In addition, we take advantage of blockchain technology to establish trust among multiple authorities and exploit smart contracts to compute tokens for attributes managed across multiple management domains, which reduces communication and computation overhead on the data user side. Moreover, blockchain helps to record the access control process in a secure and auditable way. Finally, we analyze the security of the proposed algorithm. Further analysis and comparison show the performance of the proposed method."

abstract = "In this paper, we note that the hardware Trojans that leak information through the unspecified output pins are difficult to detect by functional testing or side-channel signal analysis. Especially, the Trojans that leak the information through the side channel has proven stealthy to be detected. To solve this problem, we propose a feature matching method based on information flow tracking at high abstraction level. In this paper, the Trojans features are summarized with the format of high-level information flow tracking, which can be used to detect the Trojans. Experimental results show that our method can successfully identify the above-mentioned Trojans from Trust-hub, DeTrust, and OpenCores in less than 20 ms, showing significantly lower time complexity compared with the existing works."

abstract = {The emergence of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and design limitations of Blockchain systems for some types of applications led to the development of cryptocurrency alternatives for various purposes. Iota is a cryptocurrency with a new architecture called Tangle, which promises high scalability, no fees, and near-instant transfers, focused on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions. This paper aims to present a systematic community’s visions of this new technology and to provide minimum background to understand the Iota Tangle and ecosystem generated by this distributed Ledger. The first parts of this article describe the ecosystem behind Iota, theoretical mathematical foundation, and its challenges and solutions for implementation. In the second part, we presented systematic research about Iota Tangle in academic databases: IEEE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Research Gate. We select the articles those of high impact which can be filtered with the H5-index indicator. This criterion aims to guarantee that the papers analyzed underwent a careful selection process, evaluated by peers. The methodology used helped have a global vision of Iota, including that this innovation is not only understood as a cryptocurrency but can be considered as a “distributed communication protocol”, absence of fees, low latency, and low computational cost for sending transactions. However, there exist several challenges in the vanguard of development of this ledger. It could also be identified that this technology enables many possibilities, however, it is fundamental to understand the potentials and limitations of this ecosystem to generate the best use cases.}

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of the internet of things (IoT), traditional industries are setting off a massive wave of digitization. In the era of the Internet of Everything, millions of devices and links in IoT pose more significant challenges to data management. Most existing solutions employ centralized systems to control IoT devices, which brings about the privacy and security issues in IoT data management. Recently, blockchain has attracted much attention in the field of IoT due to its decentralization, traceability, and non-tamperability. However, it is non-trivial to apply the current blockchain techniques to IoT due to the lack of scalability and high resource costs. Different blockchain platforms have their particular advantages in the scenario of IoT data management. In this paper, we propose a cross-chain framework to integrate multiple blockchains for efficient and secure IoT data management. Our solution builds an interactive decentralized access model which employs a consortium blockchain as the control station. Other blockchain platforms customized for specific IoT scenarios run as the backbone of all IoT devices. It is equivalent to opening the off-chain channels on the consortium blockchain. Our model merges transactions in these channels for confirmation based on the notary mechanism. Finally, we implement a prototype of the proposed model based on hyperledge Fabric and IOTA Tangle. We evaluate the performance of our method through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.},

abstract = {Wide-scale adoption of the Internet of Everything requires decentralized security, responsibility, and trust among the stakeholders. All these can be achieved by a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) backbone. As a mathematical model for enabling this DLT backbone, IOTA’s Tangle is gaining popularity due to its scalability and freedom from transaction fees. Unlike blockchain, the Tangle uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, and its design does not cover essential blockchain pitfalls, including expensive Proof of Work (PoW), limited throughput, high transaction costs, and significant confirmation delays. The original IOTA is evolving into a Coordinator-less environment, the Coordicide. It requires additional modules, such as auto-peering and a reputation system, to fully exploit Tangle’s scalability and complete decentralization potential. Nevertheless, each new evolutionary update adds complexity and may introduce security threats. Therefore, the present survey’s motivation is a detailed security analysis of the IOTA. To spur developers and researchers’ interest and summarize the security status in IOTA, we have drawn the current review. Our survey outlines security vulnerabilities on IOTA and their mitigation strategies and explores several important open directions to be researched further. The vulnerabilities are discussed on both the original IOTA and its upcoming Coordicide version. In summary, this survey is first in the field for (i) understanding the basic functionalities of the IOTA, (ii) listing the security solutions provided in the literature against the reported and unreported attacks, and (iii) presenting open research questions (RQ) for directing the future investigations on IOTA.}
